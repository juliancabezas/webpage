<div id="disturbances-included" class="section level3">
<h3>Disturbances included</h3>
<p>In this run, we are only including the Deforestation and Substitution activities, we are using two default disturbances for their representation</p>
<ul>
<li>Deforestation: Deforestation-agriculture - crop-salvage and burn</li>
<li>Substitution: Deforestation-agriculture - pasture -salvage and burn</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="some-assumptions" class="section level3">
<h3>Some Assumptions:</h3>
<ul>
<li>The disturbances take place in the same moment as the land use map is released (in this case the years 2006, 2013 and 2017), so we can see some spikes</li>
<li>We are using linear growth curves</li>
<li>The initial age was taken from a 2015 volume raster, so in order to get an age in 1997, the volume was assigned to an age in the growth curves and then the difference between 2015 and 1997 was substacted, in the case of resulting negative numbers, an initial age of 1 was assigned</li>
</ul>

<div id="power-bi-results" class="section level3">
<h3>Power BI results</h3>
<p>In the following frame we can find the results for this run of the model.</p>
<p>The pages of the Power BI visualization show:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stocks in pages 1 and 2</li>
<li>Fluxes in pages 3, 4 and 5</li>
<li>Disturbances in page 6</li>
<li>Ages in page 7</li>
</ul>
